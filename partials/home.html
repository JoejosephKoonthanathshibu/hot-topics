    </figure>
    <p>Money is one of the instruments of trade and economic activity that gives value a tangible manifestation. In this
        way, it provides individuals with the ability to trade goods and services, allows people to save for their
        future, and gives a measure of wealth. The value which money represents does not rest on anything intrinsic;
        rather, it founds itself on trust in the system from which it originates and on general value from what it buys.
        Money is required to get through life, but what it does best is when it is expended wisely—to further personal
        well-being, social progress, and goals that give meaning to life.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>GMOs are genetically modified organisms in food to encourage various characteristics, such as resistance to pests, higher yields, and enhanced nutrition. The most common GMO crops are corn, soybeans, and cotton. Proponents continue to argue that GMOs can fulfill the world's need for food without necessarily applying pesticides as frequently. However, several concerns have been raised regarding its health effects, impact on the environment, and loss of biodiversity. Another issue is the labeling of GMO foods. While consensus among scientists says GMOs are safe, popular opinion is sharply divided. A central and complicated issue worldwide concerns the role of GMOs in agriculture.</p>

        <figcaption style="padding-top: 1em;">Predictions and future scenarios for the year 2100.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Climate change, advanced technology, and shifting geopolitics will reframe the world by 2100. Sea-level rise and extreme weather events shall reshape environments, joined with renewable energy and AI integration across all aspects of everyday life. Cities will have turned into smart hubs; breakthroughs in healthcare might prolong lifetimes. The dynamics of global power shall shift; new nations shall emerge in influence. The future of labor will be defined by automation—perhaps supported by universal basic income. Human colonization on Mars might just be a part of the exploration going on in space at that time. Man will then face never-seen ethical challenges, managing to make progress while saving cultural identities and natural ecosystems.</p>
